A social network for the students of Admiralty University of Nigeria.

## Goals üìç
- This project is open source because I want to give room for growing developers in Admiralty University of Nigeria to contribute to the growth of this project and tailor it to their liking as well.
- The aim of this project is to enable students on campus to connect and interact with eachother online by sharing posts, reacting to the posts of peers by liking or commenting.

I'm still working on this README so there will be more information here about this project with time.

## Basic Website Structure üèó
- Landing page
- Authentcation pages (Login/Sign up)
