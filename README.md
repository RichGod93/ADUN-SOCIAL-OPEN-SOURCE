# ADUN Social

A social network for the students of Admiralty University of Nigeria.

## Goals üìç
- This project is open source because I want to give room for growing developers in Admiralty University of Nigeria to contribute to the growth of this project and tailor it to their liking as well.
- The aim of this project is to enable students on campus to connect and interact with eachother online by sharing posts, reacting to the posts of peers by liking or commenting.

I'm still working on this README so there will be more information here about this project with time.

## üé¨ Getting Started

## Setting up Next.js
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
